This repo contains my solution to [Kaggle Titanic Prediction Problem](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview) solved using Python

## ðŸ¤” Insights

This is a classification problem, therefore I used Random Forest and Decision Tree models and got a better result using Decision Tree.

One thing that has surprised me is that with only *Age* and *Sex* features you got a better result than with other features like *Fare*.
